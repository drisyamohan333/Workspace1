Ahalia now has pride of place as one of the best hospitals in the region. Even two decades ago, staying within the limits of available resources, the clinic has managed to carve a special place for itself on account of immaculate service. A small GP clinic in 1984 has now grown to become the AHALIA GROUP -a private organization with many medical centres,16 pharmacies and trading centres functioning under it.</p></td>
